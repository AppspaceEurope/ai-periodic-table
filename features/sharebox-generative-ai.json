  "longDescription": "Sharebox enables users to leverage generative AI for creating short-form content within the AppSpace platform. Users can generate text from scratch by asking AI to write content, or select existing text and ask AI to rewrite it in different styles (such as informal). The feature also supports AI-generated media creation directly within the sharebox interface. Sharebox is specifically designed for creating polls, praises, events, questions, and short user posts, making it distinct from long-form content creation features.",
