  "longDescription": "Pages and Stories provides AI-powered long-form content creation capabilities distinct from Sharebox's short-form approach. Users can ask AI to write content, generate media for banners and illustrations, and create multi-block content layouts with images side by side with text. The feature includes translation capabilities for pages/stories into multiple languages, as well as UI element translation. Additionally, it can generate tags based on content insights, create summaries (TLDR), generate captions for news feeds, and produce audio versions of any page or story. A planned enhancement will enable complete page generation using the new assistant framework with tool capabilities, allowing connections to external systems.",
