  "description": "Framework for creating custom AI assistants with configurable tools for specific organizational use cases and workflows.",
  "longDescription": "Custom Assistants is a powerful framework that allows customers to create specialized AI assistants tailored to their specific organizational needs. Organizations can build assistants such as employee onboarding assistants, help desk assistants, IT help desk assistants, or room scheduling assistants. These assistants are designed to perform specific tasks and can be configured to appear in specific areas of the platform. They can be tied to specific communities or spaces, ensuring contextually relevant assistance. The framework supports configuration with both AppSpace native tools (such as searching for content, making reservations, or inviting visitors) and external tools using MCP (Model Context Protocol) to interface with systems like ServiceNow for ticket creation and management. This framework empowers organizations to define custom AI experiences that align with their unique workflows and employee needs.",

    "Employee Comms": "Custom Assistants enable organizations to create specialized communication assistants tailored to their needs. For example, an employee onboarding assistant can guide new hires through company resources and policies, while a help desk assistant can answer common questions and direct employees to appropriate resources. These assistants can be configured to appear in specific communities or spaces, ensuring employees receive relevant, context-aware assistance that aligns with organizational communication strategies.",
    "Space Reservation and Visitor Management": "Custom Assistants can be configured for space and visitor management use cases, such as room scheduling assistants that help employees find and reserve appropriate spaces, or visitor management assistants that guide visitors through check-in processes. These assistants can use AppSpace tools to make reservations or invite visitors, and can be integrated with external systems for comprehensive space and visitor management workflows.",
    "Integration such as Copilot": "Custom Assistants framework provides the foundation for building Copilot integrations that extend beyond standard AppSpace functionality. Organizations can create Copilot assistants that integrate with external systems like ServiceNow, enabling AI-powered ticket creation, status updates, and IT support workflows. The MCP protocol support allows for seamless integration with enterprise systems, creating powerful AI experiences that bridge AppSpace with other organizational tools and platforms."
